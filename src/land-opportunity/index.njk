        <h2 class="section-title">The Palácio do Infante as a Cultural Anchor</h2>
        <p>Quinta do Palácio do Infante D. Augusto in Cheira-Ventos traces its noble roots to the early 1600s, when Simão Lobato Quinteiro rebuilt the manor and hermitage dedicated to São João Baptista. Two centuries later, Infante D. Augusto—brother to Kings D. Pedro V and D. Luís—purchased the estate, commissioning the palace between 1882 and 1886 as a riverside retreat poised for modern innovation.</p>
        <p>D. Augusto pursued a distinguished military career as Duke of Coimbra while nurturing humanistic passions: award-winning horse breeding, meticulously landscaped gardens, winter conservatories, and prolific vineyards that grew output from eight to sixty barrels. The palace’s original domed tower, carbide-powered electricity, and private chapel embodied his vision for progress rooted in elegance.</p>
        <ul class="land-feature__list">
          <li>Adaptive reuse protects more than forty rooms—including salons, a golden ballroom, and the Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus—while welcoming hospitality, cultural, or members’ club programming.</li>
          <li>Landscape restoration revives the rose gardens, lakes, and pine groves that framed the palace and stitched together productive agricultural lands across the 190,000 m² estate.</li>
          <li>Stewardship continues under the Sande Lemos family, whose philanthropic legacy (Fundação Aboim Ascensão) and long-term custodianship keep the site’s social impact at the forefront.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After D. Augusto’s passing in 1889, the property transitioned from royal physicians to republican-era investors, later serving as a school before returning to private care. Today’s redevelopment honours that continuum—transforming heritage into an inclusive riverfront destination.</p>
