    <h2 class="section-title">Local Roots, Global Strength</h2>
    <p>Amora Vida and Surpora Lda. are backed by overseas Chinese entrepreneurs who have called Portugal home for nearly three decades. As naturalized Portuguese citizens, they are deeply committed to the communities they invest in and to the long-term prosperity of the Lisbon South Bank.</p>
    <p>They partner with seasoned Chinese developers responsible for more than 1,000,000 m² of integrated residential and commercial projects across China and Thailand, bringing institutional discipline, capital depth, and operational know-how.</p>
    <p>Complementing this cross-border expertise is a network of long-established Portuguese entrepreneurs spanning gastronomy, real estate, fashion, food supply, and stone industries. Their local relationships, supply-chain insight, and craftsmanship keep every project grounded in the region’s economy.</p>
    <p>This alliance of rooted Portuguese leadership, global development capability, and diversified financial strength underpins the responsible execution and sustainable success of Quinta do Paço do Infante.</p>
